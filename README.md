This project is a social network application created using Java and JavaFX.

Users must log in to access the app's features, and new users can create an account.
Once logged in, users can view a table of other users in the app and send friend requests.
They can also manage friend requests they've received and view their list of friends.


The application stores data in a PostgreSQL database, and event and observable design patterns were used to improve flexibility and maintainability.
Gradle was used for build automation.
